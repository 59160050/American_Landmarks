                <p>The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a
                    colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the
                    United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United
                    States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The
                    statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Statue of Liberty is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch
                    above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman
                    numerals with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.
                    A broken chain lies at her feet as she walks forward. The statue became an icon of freedom and of
                    the United States, a national park tourism destination, and is a welcoming sight to immigrants
                    arriving from abroad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is
                    said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a
                    joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work
                    on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French
                    finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the
                    head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were
                    exhibited for publicity at international expositions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in
                    Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for
                    the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph
                    Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted
                    more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in
                    France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called
                    Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a
                    dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the
                    Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service. Public access to
                    the balcony around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916.</p>
