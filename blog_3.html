                <p class="is-size-5">The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the
                    one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure
                    links the American city of San Francisco, California – the northern tip of the San Francisco
                    Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the
                    strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco,
                    California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by
                    the American Society of Civil Engineers.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-5">The Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as "possibly the most
                    beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world."[8][9] At the time of its opening
                    in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span
                    of 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and a total height of 746 feet (227 m).</p>

                    Strauss was chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the
                    bridge project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with
                    cable-suspension designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on
                    other experts. Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central
                    suspension segment) was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design
                    was conceived and championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York
                    City.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-5">Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall
                    shape of the bridge
                    towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights,
                    railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was originally used as a sealant for
                    the
                    bridge. The US Navy had wanted it to be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure
                    visibility
                    by passing ships.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-5">Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was
                    the principal engineer
                    of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his "deflection
                    theory"
                    by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting
                    forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has
                    proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong
                    windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter.[26] Ellis was
                    also
                    tasked with designing a "bridge within a bridge" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to
                    demolish Fort Point, a pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic
                    preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the
                    bridge's southern anchorage.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-5">Below Golden Gate Bridge
                    Ellis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor
                    of
                    engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil
                    engineering
                    from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve
                    years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design,
                    writing the standard textbook of the time. Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work
                    that built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931,
                    Strauss
                    fired Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too
                    much
                    money sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff. Ellis, obsessed with the project and
                    unable to
                    find work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis,
                    eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-5">With an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the
                    contributions of his
                    collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation, are largely
                    responsible
                    for the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most
                    responsible for the design and vision of the bridge. Only much later were the contributions of
                    the
                    others on the design team properly appreciated. In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District
                    issued
                    a formal report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major
                    credit
                    for the design of the bridge.</p>
